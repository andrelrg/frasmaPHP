# php-brouter

## PHP Basic router
This is a basic router component, extremelly simple with GET and POST to use and recommended for small projects that you dont want to go for a entire framework and make it heavy.

### How to use
Your project have to define a variable with the value `CONTROLLER` and its value should be the directory to your Controlller directory. If its not set, the component will put the value as App/Controllers.
